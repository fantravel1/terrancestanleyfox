            <h1>Terry Fox's Basketball Career</h1>
            <p style="opacity:0.8">From Being Cut to Becoming Co-Captain</p>
        </div>

        <article>
            <h2>The Defining Story</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox's</a> basketball journey is perhaps the perfect metaphor for his entire life. In Grade 8, he tried out for the school basketball team at <a href="/wiki/places/port-coquitlam.html">Port Coquitlam</a>'s Mary Hill Junior Secondary School—and was cut. By Grade 12, he was co-captain of his high school team and co-winner of the Athlete of the Year award.
            </p>
            <p>
                This transformation wasn't due to a sudden growth spurt or the discovery of hidden talent. It was the result of pure, relentless determination—the same quality that would later carry Terry across thousands of kilometers of Canadian highway on one leg.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "I'm not a quitter. If I set my mind to something, I'm going to do it. When they cut me from the basketball team, it just made me more determined to make it."
                <cite>— Terry Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Early Athletic Struggles</h2>
            <p>
                Terry was never a natural athlete. At 5'10" (178 cm), he was average height but lacked the natural coordination and instincts that came easily to other players. His older brother Fred excelled at sports; Terry had to work for every bit of progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Grade 8, when Terry tried out for the basketball team, the coach saw a young player who was enthusiastic but not skilled enough to make the cut. Terry was devastated—but rather than give up, he saw the rejection as a challenge.
            </p>

            <h3>The Summer of Practice</h3>
            <p>
                After being cut, Terry spent the entire summer practicing. He would shoot hundreds of baskets every day, work on his dribbling for hours, and run to improve his conditioning. His backyard basketball hoop saw more action that summer than in all the previous years combined.
            </p>
            <p>
                When tryouts came around the next year, Terry was ready. He made the team—not because he had become more talented, but because he had outworked everyone else.
            </p>

            <h2>High School Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                At <strong>Port Coquitlam Secondary School</strong>, Terry continued his basketball career with the same determination. Each year, he worked harder than the year before. He was often the first to arrive at practice and the last to leave.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Basketball Career Highlights</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grade 8:</strong> Cut from the team</li>
                    <li><strong>Grade 9:</strong> Made the team after summer of practice</li>
                    <li><strong>Grade 10-11:</strong> Earned increasing playing time</li>
                    <li><strong>Grade 12:</strong> Co-captain of the team</li>
                    <li><strong>Graduation:</strong> Co-winner of Athlete of the Year</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Playing Style</h3>
            <p>
                Terry wasn't the team's leading scorer or most flashy player. His contributions were more subtle: tenacious defense, smart passing, and an unwavering work ethic that inspired his teammates. He was the kind of player who made everyone around him better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coach <a href="/wiki/people/bob-mcgill.html">Bob McGill</a> recognized Terry's leadership qualities and named him co-captain in his senior year. The honor reflected not athletic prowess but character—Terry led by example, never asking his teammates to do anything he wouldn't do himself.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Terry wasn't our best player statistically, but he was our heart. He showed what was possible when you refuse to accept limitations."
                <cite>— Bob McGill, Terry's coach</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>University Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                After graduating from high school in 1976, Terry enrolled at <a href="/wiki/athletic-career/simon-fraser.html">Simon Fraser University</a>. He continued playing basketball at the junior varsity level, though the competition was significantly more challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry's university basketball career was cut short by his cancer diagnosis in November 1976. The same determination he had shown on the basketball court would soon be redirected toward a much larger goal.
            </p>

            <h2>Basketball After Cancer</h2>
            <p>
                After his leg amputation in March 1977, many assumed Terry's athletic days were over. They didn't know Terry Fox. During his recovery, he began playing wheelchair basketball—and excelled at it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry played for the Vancouver Cable Cars wheelchair basketball team and participated in national competitions. He won three national championships in wheelchair basketball, demonstrating that losing a leg hadn't diminished his competitive spirit one bit.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Wheelchair Basketball Achievements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Team:</strong> Vancouver Cable Cars</li>
                    <li><strong>Championships:</strong> Three national titles</li>
                    <li><strong>Years Active:</strong> 1977-1979</li>
                    <li><strong>Position:</strong> Guard</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Lessons from Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                The lessons Terry learned on the basketball court directly prepared him for the Marathon of Hope:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Perseverance:</strong> Being cut from the team taught Terry that initial failure wasn't final. The same mindset helped him continue running day after day, even when his body screamed for rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Work Ethic:</strong> The thousands of hours of practice taught Terry that hard work could overcome natural limitations. During the Marathon, he applied the same relentless approach to his daily running.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Teamwork:</strong> Basketball taught Terry that great achievements require support. He knew he couldn't cross Canada alone, which is why <a href="/wiki/people/doug-alward.html">Doug Alward's</a> partnership was so essential.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Everything I learned about determination, I learned on the basketball court. When people told me I couldn't run across Canada, I remembered being told I couldn't make the basketball team."
                <cite>— Terry Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Legacy in Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                Today, several basketball tournaments and athletic awards across Canada bear Terry's name. The values he exemplified—determination, teamwork, and never giving up—continue to inspire young athletes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps more importantly, Terry's basketball story serves as a reminder that success isn't about natural talent. It's about how hard you're willing to work and how many times you're willing to get back up after being knocked down.
            </p>
