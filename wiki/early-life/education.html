        </div>

        <article>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox's</a> educational journey took him through the public schools of <a href="/wiki/places/port-coquitlam.html">Port Coquitlam, British Columbia</a> and on to <a href="/wiki/athletic-career/simon-fraser.html">Simon Fraser University</a>, where he was studying Kinesiology when he was diagnosed with cancer. Throughout his academic career, Terry was known less for exceptional grades than for his exceptional determination and work ethic.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Educational Timeline</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Elementary:</strong> Schools in Winnipeg and Port Coquitlam</li>
                    <li><strong>Middle School:</strong> Banting Middle School, Port Coquitlam</li>
                    <li><strong>Junior Secondary:</strong> Mary Hill Junior Secondary School</li>
                    <li><strong>High School:</strong> Port Coquitlam Secondary School (Class of 1976)</li>
                    <li><strong>University:</strong> Simon Fraser University, Kinesiology (1976-1977)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Elementary and Middle School</h2>
            <p>
                Terry began his education in <a href="/wiki/places/winnipeg.html">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>, where he was born. When the Fox family moved to British Columbia in the mid-1960s, Terry transferred into the Port Coquitlam school district.
            </p>
            <p>
                At <strong>Banting Middle School</strong>, Terry first discovered his love of sports. He wasn't the most naturally gifted athlete—in fact, he was often smaller and less coordinated than his classmates—but he made up for it with relentless practice and determination.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Terry wasn't the biggest or the fastest, but he was always the hardest worker. He'd stay after practice, run extra laps, shoot extra baskets. That's just who he was."
                <cite>— Childhood friend</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Mary Hill Junior Secondary</h2>
            <p>
                At <strong>Mary Hill Junior Secondary School</strong>, Terry continued to develop as both a student and athlete. It was here that he met <a href="/wiki/people/bob-mcgill.html">Bob McGill</a>, a physical education teacher who would become an important mentor.
            </p>
            <p>
                McGill recognized Terry's exceptional determination and encouraged him to pursue basketball despite his smaller stature. This encouragement planted seeds that would grow throughout Terry's life—the belief that determination could overcome physical limitations.
            </p>

            <h2>Port Coquitlam Secondary School</h2>
            <p>
                Terry attended <strong>Port Coquitlam Secondary School</strong> (often called "Poco Secondary") from 1973 to 1976. These were formative years where his character truly emerged.
            </p>

            <h3>Academic Performance</h3>
            <p>
                Terry was a solid but not exceptional student academically. He maintained respectable grades while dedicating significant time to athletics. His teachers noted his determination and focus—qualities that were more evident on the basketball court than in the classroom.
            </p>

            <h3>Athletic Achievements</h3>
            <p>
                High school was where Terry's athletic determination truly shone. He tried out for the basketball team in Grade 8 and didn't make it. Rather than give up, he practiced relentlessly over the summer. By Grade 10, he had made the team. By his senior year, he was co-captain.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>High School Achievements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Basketball:</strong> Co-captain of the school team</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Country:</strong> Participated in distance running</li>
                    <li><strong>Athlete of the Year:</strong> Co-winner in graduating year (1976)</li>
                    <li><strong>Work Ethic:</strong> Known for staying late at practices</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Athlete of the Year</h3>
            <p>
                In 1976, Terry co-won the <strong>Athlete of the Year</strong> award at Port Coquitlam Secondary. This recognition wasn't for being the most talented athlete—it was for embodying the spirit of athletics through dedication, teamwork, and perseverance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The award was shared with his friend <a href="/wiki/people/doug-alward.html">Doug Alward</a>, who would later become Terry's companion on the Marathon of Hope. Their friendship, forged on the playing fields of Poco Secondary, would prove unbreakable.
            </p>

            <h2>Simon Fraser University</h2>
            <p>
                After graduating from high school in 1976, Terry enrolled at <strong>Simon Fraser University (SFU)</strong> in Burnaby, British Columbia. He chose to study <strong>Kinesiology</strong>—the science of human movement—reflecting his passion for athletics and physical fitness.
            </p>

            <h3>Choosing Kinesiology</h3>
            <p>
                Terry's choice of Kinesiology was deliberate. He wanted to understand how the human body worked, how athletes could optimize their performance, and potentially pursue a career in physical education or coaching. The irony that this knowledge would later help him understand his own body's response to cancer and amputation was not lost on those who knew him.
            </p>

            <h3>University Basketball</h3>
            <p>
                At SFU, Terry continued playing basketball at a competitive level. The university's team was more talented than any he had faced in high school, but Terry's determination remained unchanged. He worked just as hard to earn playing time at the university level as he had in Grade 8.
            </p>

            <h3>Cancer Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>
                Terry's university career was cut short by his cancer diagnosis in November 1976, during his first year at SFU. The <a href="/wiki/cancer-journey/osteosarcoma.html">osteosarcoma</a> in his right knee led to his leg amputation in March 1977.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his illness and amputation, Terry returned to SFU after his treatment. He was determined to complete his education, even as he began training for what would become the Marathon of Hope.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "My education didn't stop when I lost my leg. I learned more about myself during that time than I ever did in a classroom. I learned what I was capable of."
                <cite>— Terry Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Marathon and Education</h2>
            <p>
                Terry took a leave from SFU to attempt the Marathon of Hope in 1980. His plan was to return to his studies after completing the run across Canada. Sadly, the return of his cancer prevented him from ever completing his degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Terry's educational legacy lives on through the countless schools named in his honor across Canada and around the world. These institutions teach students not just academics, but the values Terry embodied: perseverance, courage, and selflessness.
