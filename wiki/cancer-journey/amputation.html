            <h2>The Surgery</h2>
            <p>
                On <strong>March 9, 1977</strong>, eighteen-year-old <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox</a> underwent surgery to amputate his right leg, six inches above the knee. The operation was performed at <a href="/wiki/places/royal-columbian-hospital.html">Royal Columbian Hospital</a> in New Westminster, British Columbia, and was necessary to prevent the spread of the <a href="/wiki/cancer-journey/osteosarcoma.html">osteosarcoma</a> that had been discovered in his knee.
            </p>
            <p>
                The surgery marked the end of one chapter in Terry's life—his days as a two-legged athlete—and the beginning of another that would eventually lead to the <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/">Marathon of Hope</a>.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Surgery Details</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Date:</strong> March 9, 1977</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Royal Columbian Hospital, New Westminster, BC</li>
                    <li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Above-knee amputation (transfemoral)</li>
                    <li><strong>Level:</strong> Six inches above the right knee</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Remove cancerous bone and prevent metastasis</li>
                    <li><strong>Terry's Age:</strong> 18 years old</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>The Night Before</h2>
            <p>
                The night before his surgery, Terry received a visitor who would change his life. His high school basketball coach, <a href="/wiki/people/bob-mcgill.html">Bob McGill</a>, came to see him in the hospital and brought a magazine article about <a href="/wiki/people/dick-traum.html">Dick Traum</a>, an American amputee who had completed the New York City Marathon.
            </p>
            <p>
                That article planted a seed in Terry's mind. If someone could run a marathon with an artificial leg, perhaps Terry could do something similar—perhaps something even bigger. The idea for running across Canada began to form.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "The night before my amputation, my former basketball coach brought me a magazine with an article on an amputee who ran in the New York Marathon. It was then I decided to meet this challenge head on and someday run across Canada."
                <cite>— Terry Fox, from his letter to the Canadian Cancer Society</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Why Amputation?</h2>
            <p>
                In 1977, amputation was the standard treatment for osteosarcoma located in the knee area. The cancer had developed in Terry's femur just above the knee joint, and removing the entire affected area was the only way to ensure the cancer cells didn't spread to other parts of his body.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, limb-sparing surgeries are sometimes possible thanks to advances in cancer treatment. But in 1977, with the available technology and understanding of the disease, amputation gave Terry the best chance of survival.
            </p>

            <h2>The Surgery Itself</h2>
            <p>
                The amputation surgery lasted several hours. Surgeons removed Terry's right leg at the mid-thigh level, leaving enough of the femur to eventually support a prosthetic leg. The procedure was considered successful—the cancer was removed with clean margins.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Terry woke from anesthesia, he faced the reality that his life as he knew it had fundamentally changed. He was no longer a two-legged athlete. He was 18 years old and facing an uncertain future.
            </p>

            <h2>Family Support</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="/wiki/people/betty-fox.html">Betty</a> and <a href="/wiki/people/rolland-fox.html">Rolland Fox</a> were at the hospital throughout the surgery and recovery. The entire Fox family rallied around Terry during this difficult time. Their support would prove essential in the months and years ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Friends from high school and <a href="/wiki/athletic-career/simon-fraser.html">Simon Fraser University</a> visited regularly. <a href="/wiki/people/doug-alward.html">Doug Alward</a>, Terry's best friend, was a constant presence, helping Terry maintain his spirits during the darkest days.
            </p>

            <h2>Emotional Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Terry later admitted that the months following his amputation were the most difficult of his life. He struggled with depression and uncertainty. The active, athletic life he had known was gone, and he didn't know what would replace it.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "It took me 14 months to accept the fact that I was an amputee. In that 14 months, I was sad, depressed, and I really didn't know what I was going to do with my life."
                <cite>— Terry Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                But gradually, Terry's characteristic determination began to reassert itself. He refused to be defined by what he had lost. Instead, he began to focus on what he could still accomplish.
            </p>

            <h2>Learning to Walk Again</h2>
            <p>
                Several weeks after his surgery, Terry was fitted with his first prosthetic leg. Learning to walk with an artificial limb was challenging and painful. The socket that connected the prosthesis to his residual limb caused blisters and sores. Every step required conscious effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Terry approached rehabilitation with the same determination he had brought to basketball. He pushed through the pain, practiced constantly, and refused to accept limitations. Within three weeks of receiving his prosthesis, he was walking again.
            </p>

            <h2>The Birth of a Dream</h2>
            <p>
                During his recovery, Terry observed other cancer patients in the hospital—including many children. He saw their suffering and the limited resources available for treatment and research. The seed planted by that magazine article began to grow into something concrete.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry decided he would run across Canada to raise money for cancer research. Not despite his amputation, but in some ways because of it. He would show the world what was possible and raise awareness about the need for cancer research.
            </p>

            <h2>From Amputation to Marathon</h2>
            <p>
                The journey from amputation to the <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/">Marathon of Hope</a> took three years. Terry had to complete 16 months of chemotherapy, learn to run with his prosthetic leg, and train for the most ambitious athletic challenge imaginable.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it all began on March 9, 1977, in that hospital room. The amputation that could have ended Terry's athletic life instead became the catalyst for his greatest achievement.
