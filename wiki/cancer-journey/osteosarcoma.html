            <h1>Osteosarcoma</h1>
            <p style="opacity:0.8">The Bone Cancer That Changed Everything</p>
        </div>

        <article>
            <h2>What is Osteosarcoma?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Osteosarcoma</strong> is a type of malignant bone cancer that typically develops in the cells that form bones. It is the most common type of bone cancer, predominantly affecting children, teenagers, and young adults. The cancer usually develops in the long bones of the body, particularly around the knee—in either the femur (thighbone) or the tibia (shinbone).
            </p>
            <p>
                In November 1976, at just 18 years old, <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox</a> was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in his right knee. This diagnosis would change the course of his life and ultimately inspire one of the most remarkable charitable endeavors in Canadian history.
            </p>

            <div class="medical-box">
                <h4>Medical Facts About Osteosarcoma</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Primary bone cancer (originates in bone)</li>
                    <li><strong>Most Common Ages:</strong> 10-25 years old</li>
                    <li><strong>Common Locations:</strong> Around the knee, upper arm</li>
                    <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Unknown; may involve rapid bone growth</li>
                    <li><strong>1970s Survival Rate:</strong> Approximately 15-20%</li>
                    <li><strong>Current Survival Rate:</strong> 60-80% with modern treatment</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Terry's Symptoms</h2>
            <p>
                Terry first noticed pain in his right knee in late 1976. At the time, he was an active athlete at <a href="/wiki/athletic-career/simon-fraser.html">Simon Fraser University</a>, playing basketball and participating in other sports. Initially, he dismissed the pain as a sports injury—perhaps a ligament strain from the physical demands of basketball.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the pain persisted and worsened. Terry recalls being in a car accident in November 1976, after which his knee pain became unbearable. Whether the accident was coincidental or drew attention to the existing problem remains unclear, but it led Terry to seek medical attention.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "I thought it was just a sports injury. I'd played through pain before. But this was different. The pain wouldn't go away."
                <cite>— Terry Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
                X-rays revealed a tumor in Terry's right leg, just above the knee. Further tests confirmed the devastating news: it was osteosarcoma, a malignant bone cancer. The doctors at <a href="/wiki/places/royal-columbian-hospital.html">Royal Columbian Hospital</a> in New Westminster, British Columbia, delivered the prognosis: without treatment, the cancer would spread and be fatal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry was just 18 years old, a freshman in university with his whole life ahead of him. The diagnosis shattered his athletic dreams and forced him to confront his mortality at an age when most young people feel invincible.
            </p>

            <h2>Treatment Options in 1977</h2>
            <p>
                In 1977, treatment options for osteosarcoma were limited. The standard approach involved:
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Terry's Treatment Protocol</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> Above-the-knee amputation of the right leg</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> 16 months of intensive drug treatment</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Prevent metastasis to other organs</li>
                    <li><strong>Hospital:</strong> Royal Columbian Hospital, later BC Cancer Agency</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                On March 9, 1977, Terry underwent surgery to <a href="/wiki/cancer-journey/amputation.html">amputate his right leg</a> six inches above the knee. The surgery was followed by an aggressive chemotherapy regimen designed to kill any cancer cells that might have spread beyond the primary tumor.
            </p>

            <h2>The Night Before Surgery</h2>
            <p>
                The night before his amputation, Terry's high school basketball coach, <a href="/wiki/people/bob-mcgill.html">Bob McGill</a>, visited him in the hospital. McGill brought Terry a magazine article about <a href="/wiki/people/dick-traum.html">Dick Traum</a>, an amputee who had completed the New York City Marathon on a prosthetic leg.
            </p>
            <p>
                That article planted a seed in Terry's mind. If a man could run a marathon with an artificial leg, perhaps Terry could do something similar—something even bigger. The idea for the <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/">Marathon of Hope</a> was born, even before Terry's surgery.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "That article changed everything. It showed me that losing my leg didn't have to mean losing my dreams. It just meant finding new ones."
                <cite>— Terry Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Why the Knee?</h2>
            <p>
                Osteosarcoma frequently develops around the knee because this is an area of rapid bone growth, especially in adolescents going through growth spurts. The exact cause of osteosarcoma is unknown, but researchers believe it may be related to the rapid cell division that occurs during bone development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry's height (5'10") and his athletic lifestyle may have contributed to the stress on his growing bones, though there is no direct evidence linking sports to osteosarcoma development.
            </p>

            <h2>Cancer Research Then and Now</h2>
            <p>
                In 1977, the survival rate for osteosarcoma patients was only about 15-20%. Many patients did not survive five years beyond their diagnosis. The treatments were harsh, and the psychological support for young cancer patients was minimal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks in part to the <a href="/wiki/foundation/">Terry Fox Foundation</a> and similar organizations, cancer research has advanced dramatically. Today, the five-year survival rate for osteosarcoma is 60-80%, with some subtypes showing even better outcomes. Limb-sparing surgeries, targeted therapies, and improved chemotherapy protocols have transformed the prognosis for young patients.
            </p>

            <h2>Terry's Legacy in Cancer Research</h2>
            <p>
                The Terry Fox Foundation has funded over $850 million in cancer research since 1980. This funding has contributed to breakthroughs in understanding osteosarcoma and other cancers, including:
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Research Advances Funded by Terry Fox Foundation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identification of genetic markers for cancer susceptibility</li>
                    <li>Development of targeted cancer therapies</li>
                    <li>Improved chemotherapy protocols with fewer side effects</li>
                    <li>Advances in limb-sparing surgical techniques</li>
                    <li>Immunotherapy research for bone cancers</li>
                    <li>Pediatric cancer survivorship programs</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Terry's dream of a world without cancer continues to drive research forward. Every dollar raised in his name brings scientists closer to understanding and defeating the disease that took his life—and that affects millions of families worldwide every year.
