            <h2>The Marathon Ends</h2>
            <p>
                On September 1, 1980, near <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/thunder-bay.html">Thunder Bay, Ontario</a>, <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox</a> was forced to stop his <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/">Marathon of Hope</a>. After running 18 miles that morning, pain in his chest made it impossible to continue. He turned to his friend <a href="/wiki/people/doug-alward.html">Doug Alward</a> and said the words that would end the most remarkable athletic feat in Canadian history: "Doug, I gotta stop."
            </p>
            <p>
                At the hospital, X-rays confirmed what Terry had feared: the cancer had returned. It had spread to his lungs, forming tumors that explained his persistent cough and chest pain. The <a href="/wiki/cancer-journey/osteosarcoma.html">osteosarcoma</a> that had taken his leg three years earlier had metastasized.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "I just want to tell people to keep trying. I've got to keep going. That's how I feel. I'm going to do my very best. I'll fight. I promise I won't give up."
                <cite>— Terry Fox, September 1980</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Nation Responds</h2>
            <p>
                News of Terry's condition shocked Canada. Television networks interrupted programming to announce that the Marathon of Hope had ended. Within hours, an outpouring of support began that would continue for months.
            </p>
            <p>
                CTV organized a national telethon called "Terry Fox: The Marathon Continues" on September 9, 1980. The five-hour broadcast raised over $10 million in a single night. Canadians from coast to coast phoned in donations, many in tears.
            </p>

            <h2>Returning Home</h2>
            <p>
                Terry was flown home to British Columbia, where he would receive treatment at Royal Columbian Hospital and the BC Cancer Agency. The Fox family gathered around their son and brother, offering the support that had sustained him throughout his life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his illness, Terry remained focused on his mission. From his hospital bed, he continued to advocate for cancer research. He gave interviews, recorded messages, and followed the fundraising efforts closely.
            </p>

            <h2>Honours and Recognition</h2>
            <p>
                In the months following the end of the Marathon, Terry received numerous honours:
            </p>
            <p>
                On September 18, 1980, he was made a <a href="/wiki/awards/order-of-canada.html">Companion of the Order of Canada</a>, the country's highest civilian honor. At 22, he was the youngest person to receive the Companion designation. Governor General Edward Schreyer traveled to British Columbia to present the award.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry was also named the Lou Marsh Trophy winner as Canada's top athlete of 1980, and received the Order of the Dogwood, British Columbia's highest honor.
            </p>

            <h2>Treatment and Decline</h2>
            <p>
                Terry underwent aggressive chemotherapy in an attempt to fight the lung tumors. The treatment was difficult, causing nausea, fatigue, and hair loss. But Terry faced it with the same determination he had shown during the Marathon.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early months of 1981, there were moments of hope. Terry's condition seemed to stabilize, and there was talk of experimental treatments. But by spring, it became clear that the cancer was not responding. The tumors continued to grow.
            </p>

            <h2>The Goal Achieved</h2>
            <p>
                On February 1, 1981, Terry's original goal was reached: $24.17 million had been raised, representing $1 for every Canadian. Terry was overjoyed. The mission he had set out to accomplish was complete, even though he couldn't complete the run himself.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Even though I'm not running anymore, we still have to try to find a cure for cancer. Other people should go out and try. That's the message I have."
                <cite>— Terry Fox, February 1981</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Final Weeks</h2>
            <p>
                By June 1981, Terry was confined to bed. The cancer had progressed despite all treatment efforts. Family and close friends were by his side constantly. <a href="/wiki/people/betty-fox.html">Betty</a> and <a href="/wiki/people/rolland-fox.html">Rolland Fox</a> never left their son's side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry faced the end with the same courage he had shown throughout his life. He was at peace, knowing that his Marathon of Hope had achieved more than he had ever imagined possible.
            </p>

            <h2>June 28, 1981</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Terrance Stanley Fox</strong> passed away on June 28, 1981, at Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster, British Columbia. He was 22 years old—one month short of his 23rd birthday.
            </p>
            <p>
                The news of Terry's death was announced to a grieving nation. Flags across Canada were lowered to half-staff. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau issued a statement calling Terry "an inspiration to us all."
            </p>

            <h2>Canada Mourns</h2>
            <p>
                Terry's funeral was held on July 2, 1981, at the Scottish Cultural Centre in Port Coquitlam. Thousands gathered to pay their respects to the young man who had captured the nation's heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                But even in death, Terry's mission continued. <a href="/wiki/people/isadore-sharp.html">Isadore Sharp</a> immediately began organizing the first <a href="/wiki/legacy/terry-fox-run.html">Terry Fox Run</a>, scheduled for September 1981. Terry's legacy would not end with his passing—it was just beginning.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Terry will always be with us. His spirit lives on in everyone who participates in a Terry Fox Run, in every researcher working to cure cancer, and in everyone who refuses to give up in the face of adversity."
                <cite>— Betty Fox</cite>
