        </div>

        <article>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Before <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox</a> dipped his artificial leg in the Atlantic Ocean to begin the <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/">Marathon of Hope</a>, he had already run over <strong>5,000 kilometers</strong> in training. For 18 months, from late 1978 to early 1980, Terry pushed his body to prepare for the most ambitious athletic challenge imaginable.
            </p>
            <p>
                No one had ever attempted to run across Canada on a prosthetic leg. There were no training manuals, no coaches with experience, no precedents to follow. Terry had to figure it out himself, learning through painful trial and error what his body could handle.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h2>Learning to Run Again</h2>
            <p>
                After his <a href="/wiki/cancer-journey/amputation.html">amputation</a> in March 1977, Terry had to relearn basic movement. Walking with a prosthetic leg was challenging enough; running seemed impossible. The prosthetics available in 1977 were not designed for athletic activity—they were meant for walking, not running marathons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry began with short distances, just trying to jog a few steps. The motion required was awkward—a hop-skip pattern that put enormous stress on his residual limb and his remaining leg. Every step was painful. Blisters formed, bled, and reformed. But Terry refused to stop.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "The first time I tried to run, I made it about 200 yards and I thought I was going to die. My leg hurt, I couldn't breathe, and I thought, 'This is impossible.'"
                <cite>— Terry Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Building Endurance</h2>
            <p>
                Gradually, Terry increased his distances. He ran through the streets of <a href="/wiki/places/port-coquitlam.html">Port Coquitlam</a>, often at 4:00 AM to avoid traffic and attention. He pushed himself further each week, adding kilometers to his runs despite the pain.
            </p>
            <p>
                By mid-1979, Terry was running significant distances. His goal was to be able to run a full marathon—42 kilometers—every day during the cross-Canada journey. He knew that anything less would make it impossible to cross the country in a reasonable timeframe.
            </p>

            <h2>The Prince George Marathon</h2>
            <p>
                In August 1979, Terry put his training to the test by entering the Prince George Labour Day Marathon. It was his first official race on his prosthetic leg, and he wanted to prove—to himself and others—that he could complete a full marathon distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry finished the marathon, completing the 26.2-mile course in a time that stunned observers. While he wasn't fast by marathon standards, the fact that he finished at all was remarkable. The accomplishment convinced Terry that the Marathon of Hope was possible.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Training Milestones</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Late 1978:</strong> First attempts at running on prosthetic</li>
                    <li><strong>Early 1979:</strong> Building to 5km daily runs</li>
                    <li><strong>Spring 1979:</strong> Reaching 15km distances</li>
                    <li><strong>August 1979:</strong> Completed Prince George Marathon</li>
                    <li><strong>Fall 1979:</strong> Running 30+ km regularly</li>
                    <li><strong>Winter 1979-80:</strong> Final preparation runs</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Physical Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                Training on a prosthetic leg presented unique challenges that able-bodied runners never face. Terry dealt with constant pain and physical problems:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Stump issues:</strong> The socket of his prosthetic leg caused blisters, sores, and cysts on his residual limb. Some days Terry would finish runs with blood seeping from his stump.<br><br>
                <strong>Leg strain:</strong> His remaining leg bore extra stress, working overtime to compensate for the prosthetic. He developed muscle and joint problems.<br><br>
                <strong>Balance:</strong> Running with an artificial leg required constant adjustment. His distinctive hop-skip gait was exhausting but necessary.<br><br>
                <strong>Equipment failures:</strong> The prosthetic leg broke down repeatedly during training, requiring repairs and adjustments.
            </p>

            <h2>Wheelchair Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                While training to run, Terry also played <a href="/wiki/athletic-career/wheelchair-basketball.html">wheelchair basketball</a> with the Vancouver Cable Cars. The sport helped build his upper body strength and cardiovascular fitness, and kept his competitive spirit sharp.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry won three national championships in wheelchair basketball, demonstrating that his athletic abilities hadn't diminished—they had just been redirected. The victories also built his confidence that he could achieve remarkable things despite his disability.
            </p>

            <h2>Mental Preparation</h2>
            <p>
                Physical training was only part of the preparation. Terry also had to prepare mentally for the isolation, frustration, and pain that lay ahead. He studied maps, calculated distances, and visualized himself running through each province.
            </p>
            <p>
                He knew there would be days when he wanted to quit—when the pain was overwhelming, when the weather was brutal, when no one seemed to care about his mission. Mental preparation helped him develop strategies for pushing through those moments.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "I got satisfaction out of doing things that were difficult. It was an incredible feeling. The pain I went through in training prepared me for the pain I would face during the Marathon."
                <cite>— Terry Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Support Team</h2>
            <p>
                During training, Terry began assembling the team that would support him during the Marathon. <a href="/wiki/people/doug-alward.html">Doug Alward</a>, his best friend since high school, agreed to drive the support van. The Canadian Cancer Society agreed to coordinate events along the route.
            </p>
            <p>
                Corporate sponsors were harder to find initially. Many companies doubted Terry could complete the journey. But Terry's determination during training runs—visible to anyone who saw him on the roads of British Columbia—gradually won supporters.
            </p>

            <h2>Ready to Begin</h2>
            <p>
                By early 1980, Terry was ready. He had proven he could run a marathon on his artificial leg. He had developed the mental toughness to push through pain. He had assembled a support team and secured enough funding to begin.
            </p>
            <p>
                On April 12, 1980, all those months of preparation would be put to the test when Terry dipped his leg in the Atlantic Ocean at <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/st-johns.html">St. John's, Newfoundland</a>, and took his first official steps of the Marathon of Hope.
