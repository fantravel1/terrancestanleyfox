            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Port Coquitlam</strong>, affectionately known as "PoCo," is a city in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada. With a population of approximately 60,000, it sits at the confluence of the Coquitlam and Fraser Rivers, about 27 kilometers east of Vancouver.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the Fox family, Port Coquitlam was home. It was here that <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox</a> grew up, attended school, played sports, and developed the character that would define his remarkable life. The city has never forgotten its most famous son.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h2>The Fox Family Home</h2>
            <p>
                The Fox family moved to Port Coquitlam from <a href="/wiki/places/winnipeg.html">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a> in the mid-1960s, when Terry was about eight years old. They settled into a modest house on <strong>Morrill Street</strong> in a working-class neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                The house was typical of the area—a small family home with a yard where Terry and his siblings could play. <a href="/wiki/people/rolland-fox.html">Rolland Fox</a> worked various jobs to support the family of six, while <a href="/wiki/people/betty-fox.html">Betty Fox</a> raised their four children: Fred, Terry, Darrell, and Judith.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Port Coquitlam was a great place to grow up. We had everything we needed—good schools, good neighbors, and lots of space to run around and play sports."
                <cite>— Terry Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Terry's Schools</h2>
            <p>
                Terry's education in Port Coquitlam shaped his character and introduced him to the sports he loved:
            </p>

            <h3>Banting Middle School</h3>
            <p>
                Terry attended <strong>Banting Middle School</strong>, where he first developed his passion for sports. Though not naturally gifted athletically, Terry made up for it with determination and hard work. He played on school sports teams and began to show the competitive spirit that would later define him.
            </p>

            <h3>Mary Hill Junior Secondary</h3>
            <p>
                At <strong>Mary Hill Junior Secondary</strong>, Terry continued to pursue athletics, particularly basketball. His physical education teacher, <a href="/wiki/people/bob-mcgill.html">Bob McGill</a>, recognized Terry's determination and work ethic, even when his skills lagged behind more naturally talented players.
            </p>

            <h3>Port Coquitlam Secondary</h3>
            <p>
                Terry graduated from <strong>Port Coquitlam Secondary School</strong> in 1976. During his high school years, he became a standout athlete through sheer determination. He co-won the Athlete of the Year award in his graduating year—a testament to his incredible work ethic.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was also at Port Coquitlam Secondary that Terry met <a href="/wiki/people/doug-alward.html">Doug Alward</a>, who would become his best friend and later drive the support van during the <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/">Marathon of Hope</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Training Grounds</h2>
            <p>
                After Terry's amputation in 1977, Port Coquitlam became his training ground for the Marathon of Hope. He ran countless miles through the streets and trails of his hometown, building his endurance on the same roads where he had played as a child.
            </p>
            <p>
                Local residents grew accustomed to seeing Terry running with his prosthetic leg, his distinctive hop-skip gait becoming a familiar sight in the community. The support of his neighbors gave Terry confidence that his mission might resonate with all of Canada.
            </p>
