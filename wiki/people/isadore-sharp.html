        </div>

        <article>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Isadore Sharp</strong> (born October 8, 1931) is a Canadian businessman, the founder and chairman of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. Beyond his business achievements, Sharp played a pivotal role in supporting <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox</a> during the <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/">Marathon of Hope</a> and was instrumental in creating the <a href="/wiki/legacy/terry-fox-run.html">Terry Fox Run</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sharp's connection to Terry Fox came through personal tragedy—he had lost his own son to cancer. This shared experience created a bond that would help ensure Terry's legacy endured long after the Marathon of Hope ended.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Quick Facts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Born:</strong> October 8, 1931, Toronto, Ontario</li>
                    <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Founder & Chairman, Four Seasons Hotels</li>
                    <li><strong>Connection to Terry:</strong> Key supporter and Terry Fox Run creator</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Motivation:</strong> Lost son Christopher to cancer in 1978</li>
                    <li><strong>Awards:</strong> Order of Canada, Order of Ontario</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Personal Connection</h2>
            <p>
                In 1978, Isadore Sharp's son <strong>Christopher</strong> died of melanoma at the age of 17. The loss devastated Sharp and his wife, Rosalie. When Sharp learned about Terry Fox's Marathon of Hope in 1980, he saw a young man fighting the same disease that had taken his son.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sharp was moved by Terry's determination and selflessness. Here was a cancer patient running a marathon every day—not for himself, but to raise money so others wouldn't have to suffer as he had. Sharp knew he had to help.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "When I heard about Terry, I thought of Christopher. Terry was doing something I wish I could have done—fighting back against this terrible disease."
                <cite>— Isadore Sharp</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Supporting the Marathon</h2>
            <p>
                During the Marathon of Hope, Sharp became one of Terry's most important supporters. He organized corporate sponsorships and used his business connections to generate donations. Four Seasons Hotels provided support along the route.
            </p>
            <p>
                More importantly, Sharp recognized the power of Terry's message and helped amplify it. He sent a letter to 999 major Canadian corporations, challenging each to donate $2 for every mile Terry ran. The response was overwhelming.
            </p>

            <h3>The Promise</h3>
            <p>
                Sharp made a crucial promise to Terry during the Marathon: if Terry couldn't complete his run, Sharp would ensure that an annual event continued in his name. This promise became the foundation for the Terry Fox Run.
            </p>
            <p>
                Terry understood that his mission was bigger than himself. Even if he couldn't finish, the fight against cancer had to continue. Sharp's promise gave Terry comfort in knowing that his work would carry on.
            </p>

            <h2>Creating the Terry Fox Run</h2>
            <p>
                When Terry was forced to stop running on September 1, 1980, and later passed away in June 1981, Sharp immediately began organizing the first <a href="/wiki/legacy/terry-fox-run.html">Terry Fox Run</a>. He used his business expertise and connections to create a sustainable model for annual fundraising.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Terry Fox Run was held on September 13, 1981, just three months after Terry's death. Over 300,000 Canadians participated, raising $3.5 million for cancer research. Sharp's organizational skills and passion helped make it a success.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "I promised Terry that if he couldn't finish, we would continue. That promise is renewed every September when millions of people around the world run in his memory."
                <cite>— Isadore Sharp</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Ongoing Involvement</h2>
            <p>
                For over four decades, Sharp has remained actively involved with the <a href="/wiki/foundation/">Terry Fox Foundation</a>. He has served on the board and continues to advocate for cancer research funding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sharp's Four Seasons Hotels have been consistent supporters of Terry Fox events worldwide. The company has donated millions of dollars and provided in-kind support for Terry Fox Runs in cities around the globe.
            </p>

            <h2>Recognition</h2>
            <p>
                Sharp's contributions to the Terry Fox legacy have been recognized alongside his business achievements:
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Selected Honours</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Order of Canada:</strong> For contributions to hospitality and philanthropy</li>
                    <li><strong>Order of Ontario:</strong> For community service</li>
                    <li><strong>Canadian Business Hall of Fame:</strong> Inductee</li>
                    <li><strong>Terry Fox Hall of Fame:</strong> Founding supporter</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Isadore Sharp's role in Terry Fox's story demonstrates how personal tragedy can be transformed into positive action. His loss of Christopher gave him the perspective to recognize Terry's extraordinary courage and the commitment to ensure that courage was never forgotten.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Terry Fox Run that Sharp helped create has now raised over $850 million for cancer research. Every year, when millions of people participate in events around the world, they are fulfilling the promise Sharp made to a young man running across Canada on one leg.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sharp has often said that his involvement with Terry Fox has been among the most meaningful experiences of his life—more significant, in some ways, than building a global hotel empire. In Terry, he found a kindred spirit in the fight against cancer.
