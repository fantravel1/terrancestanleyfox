            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Douglas "Doug" Alward</strong> was <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox's</a> childhood friend and the indispensable driver of the support van during the <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/">Marathon of Hope</a>. For 143 days, Doug drove alongside Terry across Canada, providing logistical support, encouragement, and friendship during the most challenging journey of both their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without Doug's tireless dedication, the Marathon of Hope would not have been possible. He handled everything from vehicle maintenance and route planning to media coordination and medical emergencies—all while being Terry's closest confidant and emotional anchor.
            </p>

                <h4>Quick Facts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Marathon of Hope support van driver</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Terry's best friend since childhood</li>
                    <li><strong>From:</strong> Port Coquitlam, British Columbia</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> April 12 - September 1, 1980 (143 days)</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance Traveled:</strong> 5,373 kilometers</li>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle:</strong> Ford Econoline van (donated)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Childhood Friendship</h2>
            <p>
                Doug and Terry grew up together in <a href="/wiki/places/port-coquitlam.html">Port Coquitlam, British Columbia</a>. They attended the same schools and shared a love of sports, particularly basketball. Their friendship was built on mutual respect, loyalty, and a shared sense of adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Terry was diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/cancer-journey/osteosarcoma.html">osteosarcoma</a> in 1977 and had his right leg amputated, Doug was one of the friends who stood by him throughout the ordeal. He visited Terry in the hospital and supported him through rehabilitation.
            </p>

            <h2>Joining the Marathon</h2>
            <p>
                When Terry began planning the Marathon of Hope in 1979, he knew he couldn't do it alone. He needed someone to drive the support van—someone he could trust completely, someone who understood the magnitude of what he was attempting. Doug was his first and only choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Doug agreed immediately, putting his own life on hold to support his friend's dream. He quit his job and committed to the journey, understanding that this was about something far bigger than either of them.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "When Terry asked me, there was no hesitation. This was Terry. This was important. How could I say no?"
                <cite>— Doug Alward</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Life on the Road</h2>
            <p>
                Doug's role during the marathon was multifaceted. He woke before dawn each day to prepare the van, mark Terry's starting point, and ensure everything was ready for another day of running. While Terry ran, Doug would drive ahead, stop, and wait—then drive ahead again, providing regular check-ins and water stops.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond logistics, Doug was Terry's emotional support. The marathon was grueling, and there were days when Terry wanted to quit. Doug was there with encouragement, sometimes tough love, and always unwavering belief in his friend's ability to continue.
            </p>

            <h2>The Support Van</h2>
            <p>
                The Ford Econoline van became a mobile home for Terry and Doug. It contained their sleeping bags, food supplies, spare prosthetic leg parts, medical supplies, and the growing collection of donation checks and letters from supporters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Doug maintained the van through breakdowns, flat tires, and the relentless wear of cross-country travel. He became an expert at improvised repairs, keeping the vehicle running when professional help wasn't available in remote areas.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Doug's Daily Responsibilities</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wake up at 4:00 AM to prepare for the day</li>
                    <li>Drive ahead to mark distance points on the road</li>
                    <li>Provide water and snack stops every few kilometers</li>
                    <li>Handle media inquiries and interviews</li>
                    <li>Manage donations and correspondence</li>
                    <li>Maintain and repair the support van</li>
                    <li>Coordinate with Canadian Cancer Society chapters</li>
                    <li>Keep Terry motivated on difficult days</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>The Final Day</h2>
            <p>
                On September 1, 1980, near <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/thunder-bay.html">Thunder Bay, Ontario</a>, Terry woke up feeling different. He had been coughing for days, and the pain in his chest was severe. He tried to start running but couldn't continue. He turned to Doug and said the words that marked the end of the Marathon of Hope: "Doug, I gotta stop."
            </p>
            <p>
                Doug drove Terry to the hospital, where X-rays confirmed that cancer had returned and spread to his lungs. It was Doug who called the Fox family with the devastating news.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "That moment... I'll never forget it. Seeing Terry realize what was happening. But even then, his first thought was about the cause, about continuing the fight somehow."
                <cite>— Doug Alward, on September 1, 1980</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>After the Marathon</h2>
            <p>
                After Terry's <a href="/wiki/cancer-journey/final-days.html">death in June 1981</a>, Doug retreated from the public eye. The loss of his best friend was deeply painful, and Doug needed time to grieve privately.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the years since, Doug has occasionally participated in Terry Fox Run events and granted interviews about his experiences during the marathon. He has always been humble about his role, insisting that Terry was the hero—he was just the driver.
            </p>
            <p>
                Doug's dedication to his friend exemplifies the power of friendship and loyalty. Without him, Terry's marathon would not have been possible. His contribution to the Marathon of Hope, while less visible than Terry's, was absolutely essential.
            </p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Doug Alward represents the unsung heroes behind great achievements. His story reminds us that even the most determined individuals need support, and that true friendship means being there when it matters most.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="/wiki/foundation/">Terry Fox Foundation</a> has recognized Doug's contribution, and his name appears in official histories of the Marathon of Hope. For those who know the full story, Doug Alward is as much a part of Terry's legacy as the marathon itself.
