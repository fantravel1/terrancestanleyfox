            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Rolland "Rolly" Fox</strong> (1930 – March 19, 2016) was the father of <a href="/wiki/people/terry-fox.html">Terry Fox</a>. A quiet, hardworking man from the Canadian prairies, Rolland instilled in his children the values of perseverance, integrity, and determination that would come to define Terry's character.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though less publicly visible than his wife <a href="/wiki/people/betty-fox.html">Betty</a>, Rolland was a pillar of strength for the Fox family during Terry's cancer battle, the Marathon of Hope, and the decades of foundation work that followed.

            <h2>Early Life and Family</h2>
            <p>
                Rolland Fox was born in 1930 in Manitoba, where he grew up during the difficult years of the Great Depression. Like many prairie families, the Foxes knew hardship and hard work. These experiences shaped Rolland's character—he became a man who believed that actions spoke louder than words.
            </p>
            <p>
                He met Betty Chicken in the early 1950s, and they married in 1955. The couple initially settled in <a href="/wiki/places/winnipeg.html">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>, where their second son, Terrance Stanley Fox, was born on July 28, 1958.
            </p>

            <h2>Moving to British Columbia</h2>
            <p>
                In the mid-1960s, the Fox family moved west to <a href="/wiki/places/port-coquitlam.html">Port Coquitlam, British Columbia</a>, seeking better opportunities. Rolland worked various jobs to support his family of six, including positions with Canadian Pacific Railway and as a switchman.
            </p>
            <p>
                The family settled into a modest home on Morrill Street, where Terry and his siblings grew up. Rolland was a steady presence—not the type to give speeches or show emotion publicly, but always there when his family needed him.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Dad wasn't one for big words. But he showed us every day what it meant to work hard and never give up. Terry got his stubbornness from Dad."
                <cite>— Fred Fox, Terry's older brother</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Supporting Terry</h2>
            <p>
                When Terry was diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/cancer-journey/osteosarcoma.html">osteosarcoma</a> in 1977, Rolland faced every parent's nightmare. He dealt with the crisis in his characteristic way—quietly, steadily, doing what needed to be done. He drove Terry to appointments, helped with his rehabilitation, and never showed doubt about his son's ability to recover.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Terry announced his intention to run across Canada on one leg, Rolland had reservations. What father wouldn't? But he respected his son's determination and ultimately supported his decision. "If Terry says he's going to do something," Rolland told reporters, "he's going to do it."
            </p>

            <h2>The Marathon and After</h2>
            <p>
                During the <a href="/wiki/marathon-of-hope/">Marathon of Hope</a>, Rolland stayed close to home in Port Coquitlam, following Terry's progress through phone calls and news reports. When Terry was forced to stop near Thunder Bay and the cancer returned, Rolland was among the first to reach his son's side.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Terry's death in June 1981, Rolland joined Betty in supporting the <a href="/wiki/foundation/">Terry Fox Foundation</a>. While Betty became the public face of the Foundation, Rolland worked behind the scenes, attending events and meeting with researchers. He preferred this supporting role, content to let others do the talking while he quietly honored his son's memory.
            </p>

            <h2>Later Years</h2>
            <p>
                Rolland and Betty remained married for over 60 years, united by their shared mission of continuing Terry's work. They attended countless Terry Fox Runs together, traveled to events across Canada, and watched as their son's legacy grew into a global movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rolland Fox passed away on March 19, 2016, at the age of 86. He was survived by Betty (who passed in 2024), his children Fred, Darrell, and Judith, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Rolland was the quiet strength behind our family. He never sought the spotlight, but he was always there. Terry inherited that quiet determination from his father."
                <cite>— Betty Fox</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Rolland Fox exemplified the supportive parent—one who gives their children the foundation to achieve great things while remaining humble about their own contribution. His influence on Terry was profound, even if it was expressed through actions rather than words.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fox family continues to honor both Rolland and Betty's memory through their ongoing work with the Terry Fox Foundation. The values they taught their children—hard work, determination, and helping others—live on in the millions of people who participate in Terry Fox Runs each year.
