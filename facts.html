With Canada's population at approximately 24 million at the time, this meant raising $24 million. Terry exceeded this goal, raising $24.17 million during his lifetime. His broader goal was to increase awareness about cancer research and give hope to others fighting the disease. He famously said, 'I want to set an example that will never be forgotten.'"
